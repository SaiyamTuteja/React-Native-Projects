# 📱 React Native Projects

Welcome to my React Native learning journey! 🚀
This repository contains mini and full-fledged mobile app projects built using **React Native** as I explore and experiment with new features, concepts, and UI/UX patterns.

## 🔥 What's Inside?

### 1. **Instagram UI Clone**

A clean and minimal recreation of Instagram’s core UI – including:

* **Stories section**
* **Feed with posts**
* **Basic layout styling**
* Focused on **front-end/UI** to understand mobile component design and layout.

> This was my first hands-on project to understand how to structure a React Native app and bring a popular design to life.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

* React Native components and layouts (View, Text, Image, FlatList, ScrollView, etc.)
* Flexbox and responsive styling
* Navigation (React Navigation)
* Component reusability
* UI design best practices for mobile
* Preparing for full-stack app development
